# Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) Repository

Welcome to the **VRP Repository** ‚Äì a curated collection of problems, models, and solution methods for the **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)** and its many variants. This repository is designed for researchers, students, and practitioners who want to study, implement, and benchmark optimization methods for routing and logistics problems.

## üîé About the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)

The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a fundamental challenge in logistics and supply chain management. It involves designing optimal delivery or service routes for a fleet of vehicles to serve a set of customers, subject to constraints such as capacity, time windows, or distance limits.

VRP is **NP-hard**, meaning exact solutions become computationally expensive as the problem size grows. Its importance stems from real-world applications in:

* Transportation and distribution networks
* Last-mile delivery
* E-commerce logistics
* Waste collection
* Ride-sharing and mobility services
* Humanitarian logistics and disaster relief

## ‚öôÔ∏è Repository Content

This repository contains:

* **Problem definitions**: Mathematical formulations and input data formats for different VRP variants.
* **Solution methods**: Implementations of algorithms for solving VRP, ranging from exact solvers to metaheuristics.
* **Examples and experiments**: Sample datasets, test cases, and performance results.

## üß† Solution Approaches

The VRP can be tackled using multiple approaches, each with trade-offs in accuracy and computational efficiency:

### 1. **Exact Methods**

* Mixed Integer Programming (MIP)
* Branch and Bound
* Branch and Cut
* Constraint Programming

These guarantee optimality but are limited to small and medium-sized instances.

### 2. **Heuristics**

* Clarke-Wright Savings Algorithm
* Sweep Algorithm
* Nearest Neighbor and Insertion Methods

Heuristics are fast and simple but may not find near-optimal solutions for large-scale problems.

### 3. **Metaheuristics**

* Genetic Algorithms (GA)
* Simulated Annealing (SA)
* Tabu Search (TS)
* Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
* Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
* Hybrid and Adaptive Metaheuristics

Metaheuristics are widely used in practice, balancing solution quality and scalability.

### 4. **Hybrid & Advanced Approaches**

* Matheuristics (integration of heuristics and exact methods)
* Decomposition techniques (column generation, Benders decomposition)
* Machine learning-assisted optimization
